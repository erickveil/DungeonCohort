# Dungeon Cohort

The Dungeon Master's partner in crime.

## History

This project began with the Undermountain Rooms project. Written in C++, that
project allowed me to create simple tables that returned strings when rolled on.

That project grew from its initial use of generating random rooms to fill all
the empty ones on the old Undermountain map, and the tables' return of simple
strings became more of a burden to progress.

This project learns from the lessons of the last one. The tables can return
any sort of complex objects. Much of the data will be pulled from found JSON
data files I've stumbled on in the Internet to save me from having to perform
tedious data entry, and allow me to build tables that go beyond my tolerance
for that menial task.

I'm working in C# this time. Last time it was C++ because I was working
primarily from Linux, and QT is my goto for GUI applications in Linux. These
days I'm on Windows more often, as I've grown tired of having to hack my OS to
get some basic things like drivers working. While C# has a way to go on Linux,
it's my goto for Windows apps, and probably my favorite language to work with
anyway.
